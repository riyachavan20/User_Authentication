1) For running the application split 2 terminals, type cd client and cd server on 2 terminals respectively so as to go inside the 2 folders.

2) Now type npm start on both of the terminals to start front end and back end port (We used cors for their data communication)
Front end runs on port 3000 and Back end runs on port 8000

3) You can check the package.json file in the client folder where i have added the proxy to connect with the back end ("proxy": "http://localhost:8000",  )

4) Flow of the application starts from the App.js file present inside the client's folder.

5) There could be issues regarding react-scripts so if it exists run "npm install 
react-scripts@latest" in the client folder and then run npm start.
